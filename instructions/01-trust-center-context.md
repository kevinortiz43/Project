# Trust Center Context

## Purpose

The Trust Center serves as a centralized resource for communicating CyQu's security posture, compliance measures, and operational practices to stakeholders. It provides transparency around how CyQu protects data, manages security risks, and maintains operational excellence.

The Trust Center addresses the critical need for security and compliance information during sales cycles, vendor assessments, and ongoing customer relationships. It helps build confidence by making security information easily accessible and understandable.

## Users

### Primary Users: Brokers

Brokers are the main users of the Trust Center. They need to:

- Answer security questions from their clients during sales processes
- Complete security questionnaires and vendor assessments
- Demonstrate CyQu's security posture to win deals
- Access up-to-date security information quickly and accurately

### Secondary Users: Clients

Clients (end customers) may also access the Trust Center to:

- Understand how their data is protected
- Review security controls and compliance measures
- Get answers to specific security questions
- Verify CyQu meets their security requirements

## Common Questions

The Trust Center is designed to answer questions across several key areas:

### Security Controls

- **Cloud Security**: Data residency, infrastructure security, monitoring (e.g., "How are tenants segregated?", "What regions is data stored in?")
- **Data Security**: Encryption in transit and at rest, data handling practices
- **Secure Development**: Code review processes, vulnerability scanning, secure development training
- **Organizational Security**: Incident response, background checks, security frameworks

### Operational Questions

- API protection measures
- Security monitoring and SOC capabilities
- Incident history
- Cookie and tracking practices
- Compliance certifications and frameworks

### Compliance & Frameworks

- Industry standard frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
- Security policy alignment
- Third-party assessments (pentests, audits)

The Trust Center should make it easy for brokers to find answers to these questions quickly, whether through search, browsing by category, or AI-assisted discovery.
