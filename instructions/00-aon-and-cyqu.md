## About Cyber Quotient (CyQu) Evaluation

### What is CyQu?

The Cyber Quotient Evaluation (CyQu) is Aon's proprietary eSubmission platform that helps clients identify, measure, and manage their cyber risk exposure. It serves as a comprehensive tool for cyber risk assessment and insurance placement.

### Key Features

- **Insurance Application Support**: Includes multiple insurance application question sets to support:

  - Cyber insurance placements
  - Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance
  - Professional Liability insurance
- **Cyber Maturity Assessment**: Helps clients:

  - Identify gaps in performance
  - Prioritize security spend
  - Measure year-over-year changes in cyber maturity
- **Nine Critical Control Areas**: The platform evaluates cyber maturity across nine critical control areas including:

  - Endpoint and Systems Security
  - Data Protection
  - Business Resilience
  - (And six additional control areas)
- **Benchmarking**: Provides instant access to industry peer and target benchmarks, giving clients clear insights into how they compare across the critical controls

### Why CyQu Matters

The cyber risk landscape is rapidly evolving, with:

- Global average cost of a data breach at $4.4M USD (as of 2025)
- Global cost of cyber crime expected to reach $13.82 trillion by 2028 (up from $9.22 trillion in 2024)
- Insurers constantly tightening underwriting requirements and adjusting coverage breadth

CyQu helps organizations:

- Understand their security posture and exposure to the balance sheet
- Communicate security information clearly to non-specialist stakeholders (executives, board members)
- Improve their cyber posture through Aon's cyber risk assessment and Ransomware Red Flags methodology
- Streamline the insurance submission workflow (eliminating paper applications)
- Drive stakeholder alignment by providing a framework for risk managers, finance professionals, security practitioners, and IT teams to work together

### Recognition

CyQu has won multiple awards, including:

- Business Insurance Innovation Awards
- Risk Consulting Initiative of the Year

### The CyQu Process

1. **Complete**: Stakeholders complete the CyQu questionnaire and relevant supplemental insurance applications online. Past responses can be automatically applied to subsequent year's renewals.
2. **Review**: Aon specialists, insurance brokers, and account teams walk through findings to help understand underwriting pain points and recommend vulnerability mitigations.
3. **Update**: Clients can add cyber security improvements to their application, which may help secure better terms for cyber insurance coverage.
4. **Submit**: When ready, the application is shared with brokers for insurance market placement.

## Trust Center Context

The Trust Center serves as a complementary resource to CyQu, providing transparency around CyQu's own security posture, compliance measures, and operational practices. While CyQu helps clients assess their own cyber risk, the Trust Center helps demonstrate how CyQu itself protects client data and maintains security standards.

This is particularly important for:

- **Brokers** who need to answer security questions from clients during sales processes
- **Clients** who want to understand how their data is protected when using CyQu
- **Compliance teams** who need to verify CyQu meets security requirements

The Trust Center addresses questions about CyQu's security controls, data protection, secure development practices, and organizational security measures—all of which build confidence in the platform itself.
